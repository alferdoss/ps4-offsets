# PS4 Offsets
Offsets for payloads change with every firmware on PS4. Most of these values are what devs have to figure out to have payloads working on newer firmwares. So, here we have added this repo to maintain the offsets separately for most jailbreakable firmware versions of the PS4.

These offsets have been used in the [PS4 Linux payloads](https://github.com/alferdoss/PS4Linux-Payloads) as well.
